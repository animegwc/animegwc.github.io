  <p class="descrip" >Kuronuma Sawako is completely misunderstood by her classmates.<br>
    Her timid and sweet demeanor is often mistaken for malicious behavior. This is due<br>
    to her resemblance to the ghost girl from "The Ring," which has led her peers to give<br>
     her the nickname Sadako. Longing to make friends and live a normal life, she is naturally<br>
     drawn to Kazehaya Shouta, the most popular guy in class, whose "100% refreshing" personality<br>
      earns him great admiration from Sawako. So when Kazehaya starts talking to her, maybe there is<br>
      hope for the friendships Sawako has always longed for. Maybe... there is even a little hope for<br>
       some romance in her future.<br><br><br>
