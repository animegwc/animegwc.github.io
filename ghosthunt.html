    <h1>Ghost Hunt</h1>
    <h3><p class="intro">Ghost Hunt is a paranormal/mystery series that takes place over the course of one year. The series focuses on the work of the Shibuya Psychic Research Center, particularly its teenage manager Kazuya Shibuya and Mai Taniyama, a first-year high schooler who becomes his assistant after his usual assistant, Lin, is hurt while they are working on a case at Mai's school. They are joined by a monk (named Houshou Takigawa but called Monk), a self-styled shrine maiden (Ayako Matsuzaki), a famous medium (Masako Hara), and an Australian Catholic Priest (John Brown), and later on in the series a fourth-year high-schooler named Yasuhara [episode 14]</p></h3>

After collecting data overnight, Naru begins to doubt the presence of any spirits and instead theorizes that land subsidence is the cause of all the ghostly activity.

Coupled with Masako's insistence that the school houses no spirits, Naru begins to believe someone is using a form of voodoo, calling on gods to carry out their desires. The discovery of human-like dolls under the desk and in the clubroom seem to confirm this.</td>

They discover that "orikirisama", a type of Ouija boarding, had become popular among the students, and that Sakauchi may have been one of the propagators of the trend, resulting in the many spirits inhabiting the school.

Mai's lamentation on learning the SPR have been asked to leave after the latest disasters prompts Naru to muse over a theory. He speculates that the spirits were deliberately called and expected to devour each other until the strongest remained. This spirit would possess the school, but require human sacrifices.

Lin admits Naru's PK is so powerful it can easily damage his body, which is why he does not use it. He reawakens in the hospital with the rest of the team, cheerfully visiting him in his room.</td>
