  <p class="descrip" >Since he was a child, the ambitious Izuku Midoriya has<br>
     wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him<br>
     admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems<br>
     that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero<br>
      and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability<br>
      that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!<br>
      Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a<br>
      prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program,<br>
      and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but<br>
      talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization,<br>
      Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.</p>
