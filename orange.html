  <p class="descrip" >Naho Takamiya's first day of her sophomore year of high school is<br>
     off to an uneasy start. After waking up late, she receives a strange letter addressed<br>
      to her. However, the letter is from herself 10 years in the future! At first, Naho<br>
      is skeptical of the note; yet, after witnessing several events described to take place,<br>
       she realizes the letter really is from her 26 year old self. The note details that Naho's<br>
        future life is filled with regrets, and she hopes that her younger self can correct the<br>
         mistakes that were made in the past. The letter also warns her to keep a close eye on<br>
         the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse. Naho must be especially careful in making decisions<br>
          involving him, as Kakeru is not around in the future. With the letter as her guide, Naho<br>
           now has the power to protect Kakeru before she comes to regret it once more.</p>
