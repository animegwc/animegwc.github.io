  <p class="descrip" >Nine students gather in their high school at night to bid farewell<br>
     to a friend. As is customary among many high school students, they perform a sort of<br>
      ritual for them to remain friends forever, using small paper charms shaped like dolls.<br>
      However, the students do not realize that these charms are connected to Heavenly Host<br>
      Academy, an elementary school that was destroyed years ago after a series of gruesome<br>
      murders took place, a school that rests under the foundation of their very own Kisaragi<br>
      Academy. Now, trapped in an alternate dimension with vengeful ghosts of the past, the<br>
      students must work together to escape or join the spirits of the damned forever.<br><br><br><br></p>
