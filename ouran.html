  <p class="descrip" >Haruhi Fujioka is a bright scholarship candidate with no rank or<br>
     title to speak of, a rare species at Ouran High School, an elite academy for students<br>
      of high pedigree. When she opens the door to Music Room #3 hoping to find a quiet<br>
      place to study, Haruhi unexpectedly stumbles upon the Host Club. Led by the princely<br>
      Tamaki, the club whose other members include the "Shadow King" Kyouya, the mischievous<br>
      Hitachiin twins, and the childlike Haninozuka "Honey" and his strong protector Mori, is<br>
      where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls in the academy.<br>
      In a frantic attempt to remove herself from the hosts, Haruhi ends up breaking a vase worth<br>
      eight million yen and is forced into becoming the eccentric group's general errand boy to repay<br>
       her enormous debt. However, thanks to her convincingly masculine appearance, her naturally<br>
       genial disposition toward girls, and fascinating commoner status, she is soon promoted to<br>
       full time male host and plunged headlong into a glitzy whirlwind of elaborate cosplays, rich<br>
       food, and exciting shenanigans that only the immensely wealthy Ouran Host Club can pull off.</p>
