  <h2>24 Episodes</h2>
    <!-- Description and information -->
  <img class="yeet" src="css/akame.jpg" width="300px" height="400px">
  <p class="descrip" >Night Raid is the covert assassination branch of the Revolutionary<br>
     Army, an uprising assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, whose avarice and<br>
     greed for power has lead him to take advantage of the child emperor's inexperience.<br>
     Without a strong and benevolent leader, the rest of the nation is left to drown in<br>
     poverty, strife, and ruin. Though the Night Raid members are all experienced killers,<br>
      they understand that taking lives is far from commendable and that they will likely<br>
       face retribution as they mercilessly eliminate anyone who stands in the revolution's<br>
        way. This merry band of assassins' newest member is Tatsumi, a naiive boy from a remote<br>
         village who had embarked on a journey to help his impoverished hometown and was won<br>
         over by not only Night Raid's ideals, but also their resolve. Akame ga Kill! follows<br>
         Tatsumi as he fights the Empire and comes face-to-face with powerful weapons, enemy<br>
         assassins, challenges to his own morals and values, and ultimately, what it truly means<br>
          to be an assassin with a cause.</p>
