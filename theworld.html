  <p class="descrip" >Despite the kaleidoscopic magic ingrained in everyday life,<br>
     Hitomi Tsukishiro's monochrome world is deprived of emotion and feeling. On<br>
     a night as black and white as any other, amidst the fireworks spreading across<br>
      the sky, Hitomi's grandmother Kohaku conjures a spell, for which she has been<br>
       harnessing the moon's light for 60 years, to send Hitomi back in time to the<br>
        year 2018 when Kohaku was in high school. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
