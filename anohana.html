  <p class="descrip" >Jinta Yadomi is peacefully living as a recluse, spending<br>
     his days away from school and playing video games at home instead. One hot<br>
      summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko "Menma" Honma, appears and pesters<br>
       him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but<br>
        he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago. At first,<br>
        Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he<br>
        is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta<br>
        and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but<br>
        they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest.<br>
        Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help<br>
        not only Menma move on, but themselves as well?</p>
