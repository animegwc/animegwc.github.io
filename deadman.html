  <p class="descrip" >It looked like it would be a normal day for Ganta Igarashi<br>
    and his classmates. They were preparing to go on a class field trip to a certain<br>
     prison amusement park called Deadman Wonderland, where the convicts perform<br>
     dangerous acts for the onlookers' amusement. However, Ganta's life is quickly<br>
     turned upside down when his whole class gets massacred by a mysterious man in red.<br>
      Framed for the incident and sentenced to death, Ganta is sent to the very jail he<br>
       was supposed to visit. The young protagonist is thrown into a world of sadistic<br>
       inmates and enigmatic powers, to live in constant fear of the lethal collar placed<br>
       around his neck that is slowed only by winning in the prison's deathly games. Ganta<br>
        must bet his life to survive in a ruthless place where it isn't always easy to tell<br>
         friend from foe, all while trying to find the mysterious "Red Man" and clear his name.<br><br></p>
