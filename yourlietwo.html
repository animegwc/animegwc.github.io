  <p class="descrip" >Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious<br>
     pianist Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls<br>
      into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano. Two<br>
      years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals,<br>
       and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari.<br>
       However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who<br>
       stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again. <br><br><br><br></p>
