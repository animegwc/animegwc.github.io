  <p class="descrip" >5-year-old Kouichi Sakakibara transfers into class 3-3 of Yomiyama<br>
    North and soon after discovers that a strange, gloomy mood seems to hang over all the<br>
    students. He also finds himself drawn to the mysterious, eyepatch-wearing student Mei<br>
    Misaki; however, the rest of the class and the teachers seem to treat her like she doesn't<br>
    exist. Paying no heed to warnings from everyone including Mei herself, Kouichi begins to get<br>
    closer not only to her, but also to the truth behind the gruesome phenomenon plaguing class<br>
    3-3 of Yomiyama North.<br><br><br><br></p>
