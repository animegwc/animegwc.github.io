  <p class="descrip" >Lonely high school student, Yukiteru Amano, spends his days<br>
     writing a diary on his cellphone, while conversing with his two seemingly<br>
     imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, who is the god of time and space, and Murmur,<br>
      the god's servant. Revealing himself to be an actual entity, Deus grants Yukiteru<br>
    a "Random Diary," which shows highly descriptive entries based on the future and<br>
      forces him into a bloody battle royale with 11 other holders of similarly powerful<br>
      future diaries. With the last person standing designated as the new god of time and<br>
      space, Yukiteru must find and kill the other 11 in order to survive. He reluctantly<br>
       teams up with his obsessive stalker Yuno Gasai (who also possesses such a diary),<br>
       and she takes it upon herself to ensure his safety. But there's more to the girl<br>
       than meets the eye, as she might have other plans for her unrequited love...</p>
