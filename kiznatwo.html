  <p class="descrip" >Katsuhira Agata is a quiet and reserved teenage boy whose sense of pain has all<br>
     but vanished. His friend, Chidori Takashiro, can only faintly remember the days<br>
     before Katsuhira had undergone this profound change. Now, his muffled and complacent<br>
      demeanor make Katsuhira a constant target for bullies, who exploit him for egregious<br>
      sums of money. But their fists only just manage to make him blink, as even emotions<br>
      are far from his grasp. However, one day Katsuhira, Chidori, and four other teenagers<br>
     are abducted and forced to join the Kizuna System as official "Kiznaivers."<br>
     Those taking part are connected through pain: if one member is injured, the others will<br>
     feel an equal amount of agony. These individuals must become the lab rats and scapegoat<br>
   of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind. With their fates literally intertwined,<br>
    the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more<br>
     than just the Kizuna System.</p>
