  <h1>Parasyte</h1>
  <h2>24 Episodes</h2>

  <img class="yeet" src="pics/parasyte.jpg" width="300px" height="400px">
  <p class="descrip" >All of a sudden, they arrived: parasitic aliens that descended<br>
    upon Earth and quickly infiltrated humanity by burrowing into the brains of vulnerable<br>
     targets. These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to<br>
     morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey. Sixteen year old<br>
      high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails<br>
       to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead. Unable to relocate, the<br>
       parasite, now named Migi, has no choice but to rely on Shinichi in order to stay alive.<br>
       Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile<br>
        parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species. <br><br><br></p>
