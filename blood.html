  <p class="descrip" >Peaceful schoolgirl by day, fearsome monster slayer by night,<br>
     Saya Kisaragi is leading a split life. Equipped with a ceremonial sword given<br>
     to her by her father for sacred tasks, she vanquishes every monster who dares<br>
     threaten her quiet little village. But all too soon, Saya's reality and everything<br>
      she believes to be true is tested, when she overhears the monsters speak of a<br>
      broken covenant something she knows nothing about. And then, unexpectedly, a strange<br>
      dog appears; it asks her to whom she promised to protect the village, curious as to<br>
      what would happen if she were to break that promise. Tormented by unexplainable visions<br>
       and her world unraveling around her, we travel with Saya through her struggle to find<br>
       a way to the truth in a village where nothing is as it seems.<br><br></p>
