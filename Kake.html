    <h1><center>Kakegurui</center></h1>
    <p>Second-year transfer student Yumeko Jabami is beautiful, cheerful and intelligent at first glance, but deep inside she is a compulsive gambler who gambles for the thrill of it, unlike students that do so for financial or social gain. Unrestrained by rules or logic, and with an exceptional observation ability to see through gambling scams, she quickly disrupts the hierarchy of the school, drawing the attention of the student council who frantically tries to shut her down.
