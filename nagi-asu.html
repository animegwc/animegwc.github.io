      <td>Former students of Nami Junior High School, Hikari Sakishima, Chisaki Hiradaira, Kaname Isaki, and Manaka Mukaido are forced to attend a school on land called Mihama Junior High School. Hikari's short temper towards Manaka leads to a series of events that culminate in her being caught by Tsumugu Kihara, the grandson of a fisherman, who also attends Mihama Junior High. Introducing themselves on their first day, they are met with disgust for being sea people and Hikari bites back just as harshly. This is an early sign showing the rift between the land and sea people descendants of a sacrifice (Ofunehiki) to the sea god. After school Manaka and Hikari visit Uroko-sama, the sea god messenger. Manaka brings an offering and after Uroko-sama tries to seduce her, she hits him in the face and is cursed with a fish growing out of her knee the next day. After class, some of Manaka's classmates start to invasively question her whereupon she hits her knee attempting to escape causing a fart sound. Her classmates laugh as she runs away into the forest in embarrassment.</td>

While visiting their old school building, the boys plan how they will confront Itaru about his relationship with Akari. While waiting for them in the music room, Chisaki asks Manaka if she likes Tsumugu. Manaka replies that she isn't sure. Not realizing that the boys can overhear just outside the room, Manaka wonders if she would go out with Tsumugu and if they would kiss; and if she would one day get married and have to leave the village. After hearing this, Hikari walks in acting as though he hadn't heard any Manaka's confession. The next day, Hikari confronts Itaru and follows him up to Tsumugu's house where he is stopped by Tsumugu's grandfather, who explains to them that aside from the bad mood with the inhabitants of the surface, people from the village are not allowed to marry those from outside as their children will be born without ena. </td>

But they shove her away, dropping it on the ground and cause a commotion in class. The boys reluctantly apologize only after being urged to by Tsumugu. Shortly after, Hikari and Manaka discover that someone has vandalized the Ojoshi and Hikari assumes the same boys are the culprits. He accuses them and "chests" one of the boys as retaliation. Later, Sayu admits to Miuna that she was the one who vandalized the Ojoshi, but remembering Hikari's words, Miuna reprimands her friend for doing so. While returning home, Hikari and Manaka rescue Itaru from drowning after he borrowed some diving gear to see Akari at the village.</td>

Meanwhile, Akari breaks up with Itaru, claiming that Miuna would never accept her. After Akari apologizes for causing her so much trouble and assuring her that she will not trouble her any longer, Miuna disappears.

Hikari leaves after Sayu saying that he too is disturbed by their thinking. After their meeting, Sayu reveals to Miuna that she could only move on with her life thanks to her feelings for Kaname, unrequited or not, thus she could not agree at all with the idea of losing them. On their way back home, Hikari and Miuna meet Manaka and they find a white rock that Hikari believes is the one produced when Manaka spoke to the seaslug five years in the past. He tells Manaka to keep it hoping that it will one day help her to regain her lost memories of love.

Akira gives Manaka a letter in which he declares that he loves her. Manaka runs to her room and cries because she can't understand what love is. The next day, Chisaki asks Isamu how the story of the Ojoshi ends and he reveals that the Ojoshi did not reunite with her lover because he drowned while attempting to chase after her. Tsumugu, Hikari, and Kaname meet Uroko-sama and Tsumugu informs them that when his ena awakened, he sensed the feelings of the sea god and Manaka around him. He suggests that using Manaka's stone on an Ojoshi in another Ofunehiki might return her feelings to the sea god, and thus satisfy him to restore stability to the surface, and also allow Manaka's own feelings to return to her. To their surprise, Uroko-sama agrees to help them. The villagers, including Hikari's old classmates, all join together to prepare for the Ofunehiki. While preparing, Chisaki admits to Tsumugu that she is considering taking the place of the Ojoshi, but Tsumugu strongly objects.

Miuna dives in to catch the sinking pendant and is able to hear Manaka's confession captured in the stone from five years ago that she loves Hikari. Tsumugu who dived in after Miuna also hears the confession and admits that he knew of Manaka's love for Hikari when she told him on his boat five years previously. Miuna asks why he never told anyone to which he responds that Manaka made him promise to tell no one because she knew that Chisaki was in love with Hikari. Later that night, Miuna follows Hikari along the beach and asks him if he loves Manaka. He admits that he has always loved her, and Miuna asks him to repeat that he loves her several times. Miuna runs away hoping that the pain of hearing Hikari's love for Manaka will allow her to put away the love that she has for Hikari. Also that night, Tsumugu tells Chisaki that Manaka was in love with Hikari and not him in hopes that Chisaki would accept Tsumugu's love for her. This time she does not resist while Tsumugu embraces her. As the festival begins the following day, Uroko-sama entrusts the festival maidens with the holy flame and they board the boats with Hikari and his friends for the harbor. As five years before, a storm and whirlpools form around the boats. Manaka falls into the sea but is unable to breathe underwater without her ena.</td>

Hikari is unable to break the barrier around Miuna so Tsumugu looks for help and finds Uroko-sama. Hikari blames himself for not realizing Miuna's feelings for him, and offers his own feelings to the sea god in place of Miuna. At this point, the Sacred Flame responds and Hikari is finally able to break the barrier and rescue Miuna. Uroko-sama finally realizes that while the original Ojoshi had feelings for her former surface lover, she was in love with the sea god and her children in the sea. The sea begins to move again, and many of the residents of Shioshishio start to awaken. Hikari's father is the first to return. He greets Miuna and reveals that he was listening when Hikari told him about Akira whom he wants to meet for the first time. As more residents of Shioshishio awaken, they return with the others back to the surface and are happily greeted. Some time later, Akira, who now has ena, dives into the sea to pick up Manaka as she leaves for school. Fishing resumes, and Uroko-sama points out that the Saltflake Snow has stopped falling - a sign that the cooling of the planet was halted. As Manaka and Hikari walk along the beach, she asks him if he remembers their talk from five years before when she said she would tell him something after the Ofunehiki. He responds that he already knows what she was going to say. They look to the horizon, now certain of their feelings for each other.</td>
