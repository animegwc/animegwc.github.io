  <h2 class="intro"><p>Picking up where the first season ended,<br>
     in More,Blood we return to the Sakamaki mansion and its<br>
      blood-sucking inhabitants. After resolving the mysteries<br>
       of Cordelia and her transformation into a vampire, things<br>
        seem to have calmed down for Yui Komori. That is, until<br>
         she begins to have a series of strange dreams revolving<br>
          around an enigmatic figure called “Eve.” Suddenly, four new<br>
           vampires calling themselves the Mukami brothers appear on the<br>
            scene, and they think that Yui is the mysterious “Eve!”
